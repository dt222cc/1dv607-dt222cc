##### As a developer would the model help you and why/why not?
- I believe that the model is helpful. It's clear, consistent and understandable so you will get a good idea of the projects content.

##### Do you think a domain expert (for example the Secretary) would understand the model why/why not?
- The secretary should be able to understand the model, he/she should be able to deduct what kind of responsibilities he/she have (BoatRegister & Calendar).

- Have you considered what kind of connection Secretary have with Berth? Like how can he/she know what berths is available? Does the BoatRegister have access to berths or is it perhaps through boats. In that case only the boats "with" a berth is registered in the BoatRegister.

##### What are the strong points of the model, what do you think is really good and why?
1. As mention before, the model is pretty detailed and each association has a description that describes the associations well.

2. Multiplicity is optional but included (note: missing for Event-EventDescription).

##### What are the weaknesses of the model, what do you think should be changed and why?
1. I'm not so sure about the position the description is on (above/under), it took a few moments of thinking to understand it. In this model it's counter-clockwise which is perhaps the correct way but for me, a tiny bit confusing as I tend to think in clockwise direction. In my case i didn't include them but later on I added them when i simplified my model more and yUML didnt really manage them so well :(

##### Do you think the model has passed the grade 2 (passing grade) criteria?
- The model contains the requirements that was needed for the grade so there should be no problems passing.
