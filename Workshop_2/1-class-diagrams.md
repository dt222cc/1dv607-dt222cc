# Class Diagrams
#### StudentId: dt222cc

### Notes:
- I was not sure what scope the Class diagram should be in so I had one centered on Member and Boat with addition of new class MemberList and enum BoatTypes.
- The second/other ones has MVC in it with inspiration from the other class, PHP.

## This one should be sufficient:
![class-diagram](diagrams/class-diagram.png)

-------------------------------------------------

## MVC, Structure of the application:
note: inheritance arrow direction is point at the wrong direction :D
![mvc-class-diagram-1](diagrams/class-diagram-mvc.png)

## MVC, (Same diagram):
